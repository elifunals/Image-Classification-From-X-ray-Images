# Image Classification From X-ray Images
This project is about using image classification to classify the pneumonia disease from x-ray images. Normally the original dataset have divided in two classes which are pneumonia and normal. But for this project the dataset divided into three classes, normal,pneumonia from virus and pneumonia from bacteria. 
For classification neural network model with LSTM layer was used.
